    <h1>To my dearest Rusi</h1>
    <p>A story dearest to my heart,<br>over 100 days of quiet joy.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">

    <p>Before we even met, you were already so beautiful. Elegant. Radiant. Just being you. I love your hobbies, habits, interests, and friends. You're amazing and wonderful - even before I met you. </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <img src="IMG_0838.PNG" alt="Cute Rusi"/>
    <p>But youâ€™re not just graceful â€” youâ€™re also playful, clever, and impossibly cute.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <img src="IMG_0839.PNG" alt="Lazy Couple"/>
    <p>Somehow, doing nothing with you still feels like everything to me. Deep in my heart - my most precious desire - is to sit with you and cuddle</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <img src="IMG_0840.PNG" alt="Dressed Nicely"/>
    <p>You turn ordinary days into celebrations. You make me want to be my best. You give me something worth fighting for.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <img src="IMG_0844.PNG" alt="Gil in Suit"/>
    <p>Youâ€™ve seen me serious. Youâ€™ve seen me cry. Youâ€™ve always made me feel like enough, and that I'm fullfilled.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <img src="IMG_0845.PNG" alt="Library Moment"/>
    <p>In the depth of our mind â€” without words or physical contact â€” we found something real. Something that I can only call love. In that abandonned mall, with you dancing on my feet, I feel myself today.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <img src="IMG_0846.PNG" alt="Young Gil"/>
    <p>The younger me â€” wouldâ€™ve fallen in love with you. I wish I could have met you even sooner.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ’Œ Love Letter</h2>
    <p>
      Dear Rusi,<br><br>
      These 100 days have been filled with an immense sense of belonging.<br>
      I never imagined I'd feel this safe and secure next to you.<br>
      You make me softer. You make me more myself. You also make me my better self<br><br>
      I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s next â€” but I do know I want you in all of it.<br>
      I love all the small moments, all your flaws, and everything you hold dear.<br><br>
      Yours always,<br>
      Gil
